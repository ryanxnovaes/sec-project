# Determinants of Blank and Null Votes in the Brazilian Presidential Elections

This repository contains the codes, data, and figures associated with the research project **"Determinants of Blank and Null Votes in the Brazilian Presidential Elections"**, submitted for publication in 2025. The study analyzes the socioeconomic and regional factors influencing the proportion of blank and null votes across Brazilian municipalities in the 2018 presidential election, using unit regression models within the GAMLSS framework.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Identify the determinants of the proportion of blank and null votes (PBNVS) in the second round of the 2018 Brazilian presidential election.
- **Methodology:** Fit GAMLSS models using five different unit distributions:
  - Beta
  - Simplex
  - Kumaraswamy (Kuma)
  - Unit Weibull (UW)
  - Reflected Unit Burr XII (RUBXII)
- **Data:** Proportions of blank and null votes, disaggregated Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI) dimensions (income, health, education), demographic density, capital indicator, and region.
- **Main Result:** The beta regression model with varying dispersion (non-constant sigma) showed the best overall performance according to AIC, BIC, R², and forecast error metrics.

## 🛠️ How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryanxnovaes/sec-project.git
   ```

2. Open the `sec-proj.Rproj` file in **RStudio**.

3. Run the scripts in the following order:
   - `modeling-project.R` (Fixed-effects modeling)
   - `random-effects-modeling.R` (Random-effects modeling)

4. Make sure to load the custom distributions by sourcing:
   - `KUMA_reg.R`
   - `RUBXII_reg.R`
   - `UW_reg.R`

> **Note:** Although random effects were explored, some distributions (e.g., UW , KW and RUBXII) lack established bibliography for mixed-effects modeling, thus random effects were not fully included for all distributions.

## 📄 Data Description

The primary dataset `brazil_election2018.xlsx` was assembled from publicly available sources:
- **Atlas of Human Development in Brazil** (MHDI indicators)
- **Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE)** (demographic data)
- **IPEADATA** (election-related statistics)

> The file `votesBrazil_2018.xlsx` was not used in the final analysis.
